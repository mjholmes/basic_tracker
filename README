Basic tracker

The project is to create a simple tracking PCB that can be used for tracking high
altitude balloons. The project is designed to be easilly assembled from off the shelf
modules and easilly obtainable through hole soldered components. An arduino Pro mini
is used rather than designing the board to have an ATMega328 to reduct component count
and increase reliability.
